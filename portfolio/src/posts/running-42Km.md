## New terrains

There’s something deeply personal about the way we confront our own limits. For the longest time, I’ve been drawn to boxing, having dedicated seven years to it. To me, boxing is more than a sport. It's a testament to technique, dedication, agility, and strength. However, every now and then, our hearts lead us to unfamiliar territory, and for me, that unfamiliar territory was the Cape Town Marathon.

## Taking on the challenge

The journey with running started rather unconventionally. After COVID's onset, my mental equilibrium was shaken (I'm sure you haven't heard that before). The challenges of that period intensified when a rift tore through my previous boxing gym. The sanctuary I had in boxing, the solace, was temporarily stripped away. I found myself in a void, searching for a placeholder. Without many options at the time, this led me to running, although I focused on higher intensity and shorter distances. Running was never meant to replace boxing, in my mind, it was simply a temporary escape, a way to process the changes while awaiting my return to the gym. Shout out to PFA for taking me in!

But there was an evolution in my relationship with running. From those early days of using it as a mere mental balm, over time it began to intrigue me as a discipline in its own right. That shift became evident one day after a 10km run when I found myself thinking, "What's the furthest I can actually run?" That thought stuck with me and the following week, willfully unprepared, I pushed myself to run a 21km. The only next logical step was to double it again and enter into the Cape Town Marathon, a decision that my legs would soon come to regret.

Now, transitioning from boxing to marathon running is quite the leap. Boxing, for all its individual discipline, always had an echo of community. Be it the timed rounds, the coach's guidance, or the camaraderie in the gym. Running, especially long-distance, demanded a different kind of resilience. In contrast to boxing, it presents a stark solitude. If you wish to stop midway, there is no one preventing you. It’s all on you. This innate challenge of marathon running drew me in.
This felt quite similar to being in a startup environment versus a structured corporate one. In a startup, you help chart the company's path, making decisions at every turn, while in a corporate setting, there's a set trajectory to follow. Boxing was my comfort zone, akin to a well-structured organization. Running, however, resonated more with the unpredictability and self-driven nature of startups.

## Preparation and execution

My marathon training was intense. Given that I had only two months, I aimed for 30-40km a week. It was reminiscent of my university days, where each test felt like a race and studying was the rigorous training. Just as in academics, some weeks were good, others not so much. But the key was to keep moving, adjusting, and staying focused. In addition to the training, another crucial aspect of preparing for the marathon was planning. One fundamental principle I carry with me in any endeavour, and a key aspect of problem-solving, is the importance of understanding the task at hand. This involved seeking advice from a wide range of people I knew and studying the marathon route and its various environments. Nutritional considerations also played a role in my preparations (I was even naively planning on carrying 4l of water instead of relying on aid stations. Thanks to Michael and Adam for pointing out how bad of an idea that was.) This approach was reminiscent of the common engineering technique of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sections and addressing them individually. It turns out that such practical planning and problem-solving strategies are just as valuable in the real world as they are in the programming and business environments.

As race day approached, I was thrown a curveball. I fell sick, a mere week and a half before the marathon. Irony had its laugh, as this happened right after I had confidently boasted about my good health to my girlfriend. Doubts swirled: "Could I do it?", "Was I fit enough?"

Yet, the race unfolded in surprising ways. For the first 10km, it was very hard for me to keep my planned pace as tonnes of runners swiftly passed me. This experience mirrored my time in the tech industry, where there's a real temptation to gravitate towards the newest, flashiest trends, like the surge in AI. It's all too easy to be enticed by the immediate buzz and abandon your initial direction. Just as runners sometimes start too fast and risk burning out, in tech, jumping ship to the latest trend without a proper strategy can be detrimental. Sticking to your plan and trusting the process, be it in a marathon or in business, often pays off in the end.

Strategy and endurance paid off as from 10 to 30km, I steadily regained ground. By the 35km mark, I hit the notorious "wall™," and my pace started to fade, it became less about physical endurance and more about mental grit. My legs were far past their intended mileage but I knew stopping would make it nearly impossible to start again. That final stretch brought intrusive introspection. The real dangerous question of “Why the hell am I doing this?” arose. It's crucial to know the answer to our ‘'why' before challenges amount. Pre-empting doubts with a strong purpose can anchor us during trying times. This realization isn't just confined to marathons, it permeates every ambitious endeavour, from launching a company to any personal milestone.

This phase of challenging the “why” reminded me that during uncertain times, where your end goal may become elusive, one should re-focus on the immediate, present steps, rather than the looming entirety of the journey. Sometimes it takes time to find the answer to that “why”, sometimes the answer can change, and that’s okay. As discussed in my previous blog, after I finished university my big-picture goal was shaken up a bit as I realised my startup was not on track to succeed. During the time of reorientation, I still made that effort to keep progressing and move forward, finding a new home at Liquidium.

## Making it to the finish Line

Finishing the race brought immense relief, yet the age-old question lingered: What's next? We, humans, are always seeking the next challenge. I might not continue my role of doubling the distance just yet, but an ultra marathon is definitely in the picture. While completing milestones it's essential to focus on our personal journey, set our benchmarks, and not be bogged down by others' progress. I'd set a target to finish within 4 hours and 30 minutes and surpassed it by 15. A lesson that success lies in self-improvement, not in outdoing others.

My gratitude extends to everyone who supported me in this journey. From friends and family who offered invaluable advice to strangers cheering from the sidelines, it was a vivid reminder that we're never truly alone in our endeavours. In life's marathon, there are always well-wishers, visible or otherwise.

Historically, I've wrestled with the notion of going solo, armed with the mindset that it's me against the world. This perspective, while providing a sense of resilience, often obscured the vast resources and supportive individuals that surrounded me. The marathon was a clear metaphor for this realization. Just as the myriad of supporters lined the route, in life too, there are countless individuals and opportunities that can aid our journey, if only we choose to recognize them. Acknowledging this, I've begun to take proactive steps: attending more events, consistently engaging in continuous learning within my field, and trying to broadening my network. By doing so, I'm not just enhancing my professional capabilities but also building bridges and fostering connections. The world, as it turns out, is far more willing to help than hinder, provided we reach out and embrace it.

So, reflecting on this incredible marathon journey, I've drawn parallels and extracted five key takeaways that mirror both life and my early career:

###

- **Understanding the Task:** Break down complex problems into manageable sections and address them individually, drawing on advice and planning, akin to engineering or business problem-solving strategies.

- **Adhering to Strategy:** The journey highlights the temptation of veering off course, akin to runners starting out too fast or the tech industry's allure to the latest trend. However, it's crucial to remain true to our devised plans and strategies.

- **Knowing Your 'Why':** Understanding our core motivations anchors us during tumultuous times. Whether it's pushing past the 35km mark or persisting through a startup's challenges, knowing our "why" is crucial.

- **Focus on Self-Improvement:** Success is better measured by personal growth and achieving self-set goals, rather than comparing oneself to others, emphasizing continuous self-improvement.

- **Embracing Support and Networking:** Acknowledge the support around you, be it in a marathon or in professional life, and actively engage in networking and continuous learning to foster connections and seize opportunities.

Cheers,
Luke
